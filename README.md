**AI Email Management Desktop App**

> An open-source on-device conversational AI email client desktop application that leverages your local PC's NPU

---

## Application Description

MailPilot AI is an AI email management application that integrates with Gmail accounts to automatically classify and summarize emails, generate AI-based auto-replies, and other features. It adds convenience to email usage by providing functions that email users have not been able to utilize before, offering these features through a conversational interface.

This desktop app was developed using React and Flask frameworks with Tauri, running AI models on Qualcomm Copilot+ PC NPUs to minimize dependency on existing cloud-based environments.

### Key Features Using AI Models

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Spam/Important/Sent/Self-sent/Filtered | Automatically classify and view emails by tabs |
| Email Summary View | Preview email content summaries in the list view |

| Attachment Summary Function | Automatically summarize attached images and document content |

- Gmail 2-step verification must be activated

### System Requirements
- Backend API server must be running first
- Internet connection required (for Gmail access and AI model usage)

### Token Issuance Required
- Currently requires tokens from Hugging Face due to lack of Qualcomm devices, as specified in app.py
- Need to obtain tokens from Nomic and Hugging Face and modify accordingly
- Future plans to use Qualcomm AI hub to download models for local use
