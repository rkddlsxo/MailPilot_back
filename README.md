# E.M.Pilot - Backend

**AI-powered Email Management Desktop App (Tauri-based)**

> Local PC NPU-powered, open-source on-device conversational AI email client

## Application Description

E.M.Pilot is a smart email management desktop application that integrates with Gmail accounts to automatically classify and summarize emails, generate AI-based replies, and provides features that email users haven't been able to utilize before or adds convenience to their usage through a conversational interface. It's a desktop app developed using React and Flask frameworks with Tauri, utilizing local PC NPU to run AI models, minimizing cloud dependency.
